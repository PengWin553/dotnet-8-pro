1. What's the difference in the process of create and update methods in the controller?

    - Create Flow:
        > User Input → CreateStockRequestDto (validated) → Convert to Model → Repository

            - DTO is validated by ASP.NET Core model binding
            - DTO is converted to Model via mapper
            - Model is passed to repository

    - Update Flow:
        > User Input → UpdateStockRequestDto (validated) → Repository (uses DTO properties directly)

            - DTO is validated by ASP.NET Core model binding
            - DTO is NOT converted to a model
            - Repository uses DTO properties to update existing entity

        - NOTE: 
                - If you create an UpdateMapper, you can make the update method follow the same pattern as create, but it's optional - both approaches are valid.

                - Which Approach to Choose?
                    - Simple projects: Direct property assignment is fine
                    - Complex projects: Use mappers for consistency and maintainability
