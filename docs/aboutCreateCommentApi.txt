1. CreateCommentDto Mapper - Converts the incoming DTO to a Comment domain model using commentDto.ToCommentFromCreate(stockId), properly binding the comment to the specified stock
2. Something to Find if a Stock passed from Route Exists - Validates the stock existence through _stockRepo.StockExists(stockId) before allowing comment creation, preventing comments on non-existent stocks
3. An Interface and Repository code that Contracts the Controller to the Comment FindStock and CreateAsync - Uses dependency injection with repository interfaces to decouple the controller from direct database operations, providing clean separation between the API layer and data access layer
4. CommentRepository CreateAsync to interact with the database - Handles the actual database persistence of the new comment model through the repository pattern
5. Displays the new comment in json format in the response when using Swagger - Returns the newly created comment as a JSON response using commentModel.ToCommentDto(), following REST conventions with CreatedAtAction to provide the proper 201 status code and location header

===================== MORE BREAKDOWN ==================
await _commentRepo.CreateAsync(commentModel); 

    1. _commentRepo = This is the dependency injection part - it's an interface (like ICommentRepository) that gets injected into the controller, following the repository pattern with interface + repository implementation codes
    2. CreateAsync(commentModel) = This passes the comment model to the CreateAsync function that's implemented in the actual Comment Repository class
